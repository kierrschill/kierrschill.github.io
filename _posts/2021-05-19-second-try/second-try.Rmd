For my Senior Project, I am working with a local credit union here in Idaho. While the details are to subject change, the scope of the project is that company just opened a branch in a new city, and would like to learn more about the area where they are opening. I am grateful to be working along side this company for the time being, and I hope to create something that they can use in the future. And, I'm excited to document what I'm doing for this project!

Each week, I plan on writing at least one post of something I've accomplished for the project. While I won't share any private, company data, I will share data that is available to the public, such as census data (hint for my next post!).

Thank you for reading and come again!
